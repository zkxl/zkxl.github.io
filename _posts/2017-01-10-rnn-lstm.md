__These deeplearning series are inspired by Stanford open course — cs231n. My special thanks.__


_Deeplearning is involved in a wide range of techniques that allow a neural network to make reliable predications. This series will introduce several key components of a neural network, from linear classifier loss functions to fully connected neural nets, from convNets to RNN._

### Word embedding

Word embedding is a process that maps text input to a high-dimension numerical input. Each word becomes a word vector comprised of numbers.
We will start from a given vocabulary (V, D) that's comprised V different word vectors. And then we will map each word in the input text (N, T), with N captions and T words in each caption, to a input matrix - (N, T, D). The above process is word embedding.

``` python
def word_embedding_forward(x, W):

  """
  Forward pass for word embeddings. We operate on minibatches of size N where each sequence has length T. We assume a vocabulary of V words, assigning each to a vector of dimension D.

  Inputs:
  - x: Integer array of shape (N, T) giving indices of words. Each element idx of x muxt be in the range 0 <= idx < V.
  - W: Weight matrix of shape (V, D) giving word vectors for all words.

  - out: Array of shape (N, T, D) giving word vectors for all input words.

### LSTM

__If there's only one thing that's logically challenging in these series. I found that is back-propagation. Understanding LSTM back-propagation will be the least trivial thing, with the batchnorm back-propagation being the second least. I strongly encourage any reader start by understanding how to backprop through computational graph as illustrated in cs231n, and then draw a computational graph for LSTM model and go through the following code step by step.__

* A [TODO] for myself: add a computational graph here to facilitate understanding - ...

$$ i = \sigma (x_t {w_{x}}^i + h_{t-1} {w_{h}}^i + b^i) $$

$$ f = \sigma (x_t {w_{x}}^f + h_{t-1} {w_{h}}^f + b^f) $$

$$ o = \sigma (x_t {w_{x}}^o + h_{t-1} {w_{h}}^o + b^o) $$

$$ g = \tanh (x_t {w_{x}}^g + h_{t-1} {w_{h}}^g + b^g) $$

$$ c_t = c_{t-1} \circ f + g \circ i $$

$$ h_t = \tanh(c_t) \circ o $$

### Note

* A typical recurrent neural network starts from word embedding, going through recurrent cells for T times and finally reach the scoring stage. The output will be transform back to text captions using the same vocabulary.

* this is to explain how np.add.at() works in our case

``` python
# np.add.at(a, indices, b) performs addition on operand a indiced by "indices" and operand b. b could be constant, broadcastable array, OR in this case -
# an array of the same length as the indices array, so that, elements in b will be added into a[indices] in order.

# paste the following code in a notebook to see how it works

N, T, V, D = 3, 2, 9, 4
x = np.random.randint(0, 9, size = (N, T))
print "array of integers representing words"
print x
w = np.random.randn(V, D)
print "word vectors for each word in vocabulary"
print w
print "word vectors for each word of input"
print w[x]
print np.prod(x.shape)

out = w[x]
dout = np.arange(N * T * D).reshape(N, T, D) # same shape as out
dw = np.zeros_like(w)
np.add.at(dw, x.reshape(-1), dout.reshape(N*T, D))
print "indices:"
print x.reshape(-1)
print "the other operand:"
print dout.reshape(N * T, D)
print "result:"
print dw
