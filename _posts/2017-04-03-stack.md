## Stack

### Object-oriented Implementation

High-level description:
1. A stack is a collection of __objects__.
2. Each object has a value pointer and a next pointer.
3. __Value pointer__ points to the value of the object while the __next pointer__ points to the object that came previously.
4. The stack data structure has a __top pointer__ points to last came-in object.

``` python
class StackNode():
  def __init__(self, val):
    self.val = val
    self.next = None

class Stack():
  def __init__(self):
    self.top = NULL
    # the whole class is just a pointer to NULL upon initialization

  def push(self, val):
    node = StackNode(val)
    node.next = self.top
    self.top = node

  def pop(self):
    val = self.top.val
    self.top = self.top.next
    return val
```

__Analysis:__
1. No loop no subroutines. O(1) to push or pop.

__NOTE:__
1. __Locality__ is not good because every object is a node randomly placed in memory.
2. __Persistence:__ this implements stack as a [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure).  
Basically, the next state of the data structure is built on the current state. No in-place modification occurs. Each state can be preserved.  
For example, as long as you keep a pointer to some node in state A, even though some subroutines modified the stack to state B, you can still refer back to the node in state A as if nothing has been modified.


### Array-based Implementation

High-level description:
1. A stack is an array, assuming the array size is sufficiently large within our scope.
2. Maintain a __top indexer(int)__ pointing at the last came-in value in the array.

``` python
class Stack():
  def __init__(self):
    self.A = [LARGE]
    self.top = 0

  def push(self, val):
    self.top += 1
    self.A[self.top] = val

  def pop(self):
    val = self.A[self.top]
    self.top -= 1
    return val
```

__Analysis:__
1. No loop no subroutines, O(1) to push or pop.
2. Theoretically 2 times more efficient in space usage because every value comes in with a pointer in object-oriented implementation.

__Note:__
1. Memory locality is good.
2. Potential memory usage waste is the only downside here. It depends on how good your estimate is.
3. Minor: array indexing access is a little bit more efficient than pointer access.

### Classic Use case - Nearest neighbor chain algorithm:

Naive Hierarchical Clustering takes O(n^2) to decide the next pair of clusters to merge.  

Stack-based Hierarchical Clustering takes O(n). Here's the magic:  

``` python
S = new Stack()
while the number of clusters > 1:
  if S.isEmpty(): S.push(some arbitrary cluster centroid)
  c = the most top value on stack # O(1)
  n = the nearest neighbor of c # O(n)

  # checking if they are the same point can be done in O(1) with some optimization
  if S has some value next to c and n equals to that value:
    c = S.pop()
    n = S.pop()
    merge(c, n) # re-compute centroid
  else:
    S.push(n) # go to next loop, check n's nearest neighbor

"""
This is a tricky algorithm to think about, you'd better do a hand stimulation by drawing a sequence of points on a line with decreasing distances between one and the next.
